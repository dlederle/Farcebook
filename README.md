Farcebook
=========

This was the final project of "The Gang of Four" for CPSC 330.
I wrote a [post-mortem](http://dlederle.com/2012/01/09/farcebook/) with my perspective on the development.

The source is pretty ugly, we were learning as we wrote and didn't have time to tidy things up before turning it in.
